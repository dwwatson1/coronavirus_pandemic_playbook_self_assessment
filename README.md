# Coronavirus Pandemic Playbook Self-Assessment

## Role and Team Contributions

From start to beginning of our group's Coronavirus Pandemic Playbook final project, I was the project manager. In addition to admin tasks, like setting up meetings, leading meetings, and creating meeting agendas, I was primarily responsible for assembling and beautifying our GitHub's README. This required me to understand and all team member's tasks along the way, as I needed to explain our process and reasoning in each section. Having a large six-person group had its challenges. I was worried the work might not be split up evenly, but I'm very proud of my teammembers abilities to take their own responsibilities and deliver for the team. In the fourth week of the project, I assisted Michael with data assembling, cleaning, and feature engineering, so we could run our machine learning model a fourth time. 

## Other Contributions

Our group worked very well together because we were all experts in our respective tasks. While I didn't touch the SQL part of the database or assembling the Tableau dashboard, I sythesized their contributions in the README. I also gave them suggestions of how to present their sections in the written portion and when we presented to the class. Finally, I approved their README contributions and created checklists during each deliverable to make sure we were hitting all the marks for our grade.

## Project Challenges

The greatest challenge during these four weeks was getting my group members to buy-in to a fourth machine learning model run. At first, we thought we would have to redo everything, including our database, data dictionary, and machine learning model. Michael had and plan and explained it very well. I threw my support behind him because I knew we could accomplish something interesting in the final model run. I had a little trouble winning over support from our other teammembers, so I reframed what we were doing as building off of the past three model runs, not redoing. I helped with data assembling, cleaning, and feature engineering to lighten his load, and the exercise of doing it helped me understand the project better. In the end, our instructors and TA's were impressed with the work we put in. I'm extremely proud of what this group accomplished and myself. For 24 weeks, I grinded each week and weekend to get to where I am now. Kudos to my group and and to our instructors and TA's who challenged us and provided excellent guidance
